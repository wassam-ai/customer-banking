# Customer Banking System

--> Used the starter files provided for the challenge module 4; Accounts.py, savings_account.py, cd_account.py 
and customer_banking.py 

--> First added the starter files to the repository and pushed those to the online repo after commiting

--> Implemented all the required functionalities in the savings_account.py file and the cd_account.py file

--> Imported the create functions from both savings_account.py and cd_account.py files into the 
customer_banking.py file

--> Used the create functions of each of these two classes to create savings_account and cd_account in main 
function inside the customer_banking.py file.  

--> Finally, printed the interests earned and updated balances of each of the two accounts(savings and CD) 
created in main(), using the functions defined in savings_account.py and cd_account.py files
